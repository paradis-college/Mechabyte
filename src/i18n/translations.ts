    // Game strategy content
    centerstageAutonomous: 'Robot starts with a pre-loaded pixel in the intake claw. No odometry is used; all movements are based on timing. We have two main starting positions: backstage-facing (drive straight to park and drop pixel) and audience-facing (drive forward to tile C2, then sideways to backstage).',
    centerstageTeleOp: 'Drivers navigate through the truss or stage door to collect pixels from stacks or the human station. We deliver one pixel at a time to the backdrop. If a pixel falls in backstage, we leave it and fetch another. Our goal is to form mosaics and cross lines on the backdrop for bonus points.',
    centerstageEndgame: 'We continue scoring pixels for 15-20 seconds, then launch the drone and park in backstage for additional points.',
    intoTheDeepTeleOp: 'We navigate to pick up one sample at a time from the field or submersible. Samples are placed in the highest basket in the net zone. If a sample falls, we abandon it and fetch a new one to maximize scoring efficiency.',
    intoTheDeepEndgame: 'We continue scoring in the high basket until the final seconds, then launch the drone and park in the net zone for maximum points.',

    // Robot evolution content
    centerstageDriveTrainEvolution: 'Started with an X-drive chassis with omni wheels at 45°—stable but too small for all components. Intermediate version used X-drive with flipped metal bars; the control hub was attached with one screw and a zip tie, making it fragile and prone to deformation. Final version features a more stable, spacious chassis with an Expansion Hub, mecanum wheels, and custom holders for hubs, power switch, and motors.',
    centerstageIntakeEvolution: 'First version was a dynamic intake with a spinning shaft and toilet-brush head pushing pixels up a ramp into two-pixel storage. Dropped due to lack of motors (all 4 used by drive train, no expansion hub). Second version used a single-pixel claw with position servo and toothed wheel—more precise but required accurate alignment. Third version featured a claw opening at an angle using two meshed toothed wheels, making pixel grabbing easier.',
    centerstageArmEvolution: 'Pantograph-inspired arm (like tram pantographs) keeps the intake angle constant while raising or lowering, eliminating constant readjustment needs. Initially powered by one, then two continuous-rotation servos (insufficient torque caused sagging). Later upgraded to a Tetrix 40:1 motor after obtaining the Expansion Hub.',
    centerstageLauncherEvolution: 'Thin plate with three channels for drone, elastic band, and sliding rod. The elastic is held under tension by the rod; releasing it launches the drone to scoring zones. Rod is attached to a position servo, armed during auto/tele-op, and released during endgame. Second version improved mounting with custom chassis holes.',
    intoTheDeepFirstVersion: 'Initial design had several problems: oversized claw that couldn\'t close fully (specimens often fell), heavy intake using butcher-shop material blades to pull samples into storage (too heavy, acted as obstacle when moving forward, blades often aligned and failed to grab), horizontal viper slide with off-center wobbly motor and few support points, vertical viper slide for baskets and submersible (off-center, difficult to attach suitable claw), and a storage box that didn\'t reach the basket with insufficient space.',
    intoTheDeepUpgradeAttempts: 'We redesigned the claw shape to better fit specimens, but sides didn\'t align well, making gripping difficult. At the first meet, the intake got stuck on the submersible zone edge. The system was too slow, heavy, and fragile. We chose not to use the claw due to these issues.',
    intoTheDeepCurrentVersion: 'Simplified design with a single vertical slider and attached arm. No transfer between containers—intake grabs sample and slider lifts directly to high basket. Benefits: easily reach high basket, lighter but more durable intake, straight alignment helps precise scoring. Remaining challenge: arm movement due to imperfect hex motor attachment to slider.',
    intoTheDeepConstructionImprovements: 'Stabilized intake with two extra structural parts. Replaced butcher-shop blades and added stoppers to prevent parallel turning. Created 3D-printed discs with hexagonal centers to lock blades on shaft, fixing rotation issues.',

    // Programming content
    programmingDescription: 'Both seasons used time-based autonomous because we had no cameras or sensors. Movements are sequences of forward/back/left/right moves with fixed durations. Sometimes we use reduced power at the end to ensure full parking in the zone or backstage.',
    driverLayoutDescription: 'Centerstage: Initially a single driver handled all tasks due to phone power-delivery issues with two gamepads (Motorola G4 Play). With a new phone (Nokia 5), we split tasks between driver 1 (movement + arm/launcher) and driver 2 (intake). Into the Deep: Driver 1 controls robot movement and slider extension; driver 2 controls intake, out-take, and arm.',

    // Robot evolution content
    centerstageDriveTrainEvolution: 'Am început cu un șasiu X-drive cu roți omni la 45°—stabil dar prea mic pentru toate componentele. Versiunea intermediară a folosit X-drive cu bare metalice răsturnate; control hub-ul era atașat cu un șurub și un colier, făcându-l fragil și predispus la deformare. Versiunea finală prezintă un șasiu mai stabil și spațios cu Expansion Hub, roți mecanum și suporturi personalizate pentru hub-uri, întrerupător și motoare.',
    centerstageIntakeEvolution: 'Prima versiune era o colectare dinamică cu ax rotativ și cap de perie de toaletă împingând pixeli pe o rampă în depozit cu două pixeli. Abandonată din cauza lipsei de motoare (toate 4 folosite de trenul de rulare, fără expansion hub). A doua versiune folosea o gheară cu un singur pixel cu servo de poziție și roată dințată—mai precisă dar necesita aliniere exactă. A treia versiune avea o gheară deschizându-se în unghi folosind două roți dințate angrenate, făcând colectarea pixelilor mai ușoară.',
    centerstageArmEvolution: 'Braț inspirat de pantograf (ca pantografele de tramvai) menține unghiul de colectare constant la ridicare sau coborâre, eliminând nevoia de reajustare constantă. Inițial alimentat de unul, apoi două servo-uri cu rotație continuă (cuplu insuficient cauzând atârnare). Mai târziu actualizat la un motor Tetrix 40:1 după obținerea Expansion Hub-ului.',
    centerstageLauncherEvolution: 'Placă subțire cu trei canale pentru dronă, bandă elastică și tijă glisantă. Elasticul este ținut sub tensiune de tijă; eliberarea acesteia lansează drona către zonele de punctaj. Tija este atașată de un servo de poziție, armată în timpul auto/tele-op și eliberată în endgame. A doua versiune a îmbunătățit montarea cu găuri personalizate în șasiu.',
    intoTheDeepFirstVersion: 'Designul inițial avea mai multe probleme: gheară supradimensionată care nu se putea închide complet (specimene cădeau des), colectare grea folosind lame de material de măcelărie pentru a trage mostre în depozit (prea grea, acționa ca obstacol la mișcarea înainte, lamele se aliniau des și nu reușeau să apuce), glisieră viper orizontală cu motor instabil decentrat și puține puncte de susținere, glisieră viper verticală pentru coșuri și submersibil (decentrată, dificil de atașat o gheară potrivită), și o cutie de depozitare care nu ajungea la coș cu spațiu insuficient.',
    intoTheDeepUpgradeAttempts: 'Am reproiectat forma ghearei pentru a se potrivi mai bine specimenelor, dar laturile nu se aliniază bine, făcând prinderea dificilă. La prima întâlnire, colectarea s-a blocat pe marginea zonei submersibilului. Sistemul era prea lent, greu și fragil. Am ales să nu folosim gheara din cauza acestor probleme.',
    intoTheDeepCurrentVersion: 'Design simplificat cu o singură glisieră verticală și braț atașat. Fără transfer între containere—colectarea apucă mostra și glisiera ridică direct la coșul înalt. Beneficii: ajungem ușor la coșul înalt, colectare mai ușoară dar mai durabilă, alinierea dreaptă ajută la punctaj precis. Provocare rămasă: mișcarea brațului din cauza atașării imperfecte a motorului hex la glisieră.',
    intoTheDeepConstructionImprovements: 'Colectare stabilizată cu două părți structurale suplimentare. Înlocuite lamele de măcelărie și adăugate opritori pentru a preveni rotația paralelă. Create discuri imprimate 3D cu centre hexagonale pentru a fixa lamele pe ax, rezolvând problemele de rotație.',

    // Programming content
    programmingDescription: 'Ambele sezoane au folosit autonom bazat pe timp deoarece nu aveam camere sau senzori. Mișcările sunt secvențe de deplasări înainte/înapoi/stânga/dreapta cu durată fixă. Uneori folosim putere redusă la final pentru a asigura parcarea completă în zonă sau backstage.',
    driverLayoutDescription: 'Centerstage: Inițial un singur șofer gestiona toate sarcinile din cauza problemelor de alimentare cu două gamepad-uri (Motorola G4 Play). Cu un telefon nou (Nokia 5), am împărțit sarcinile între șoferul 1 (mișcare + braț/lansator) și șoferul 2 (colectare). Into the Deep: Șoferul 1 controlează mișcarea robotului și extensia glisierei; șoferul 2 controlează colectarea, evacuarea și brațul.',
